    Frame timestamps use real decode time (frame_index / fps) so trigger
    timeouts behave as they would on a live camera. Decoding stops at the first
    cue (the ladder takes over from there) or end of clip / max_seconds.

    ``sample_hz`` processes a real-time sample grid (e.g. 5 Hz → every 6th
    frame at 30 fps): timestamps stay in real seconds, validated on the
    KU Leuven fall clips (sudden-fall signature survives 5 Hz sampling),
    while DNN cost drops ~6x for CPU-bound containers.

    ``prefer_distress`` keeps scanning after a non-distress cue and returns
    the distress cue if one fires later in the clip (a fall anywhere in an
    upload outranks an earlier stillness cue); otherwise the first cue wins.
